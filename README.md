====

**esoteric** is a repo of all my projects that are for fun.  They shouldn't be used as they aren't meant to be.  Newest projects are at the bottom of the list.

A new project will begin every 1 or 2 weeks.

# Projects

An esoteric visual language.  More info in README.md of staircase.

## ulang

## LM

An experimental language based off of the idea of giving the user the ability to delay evaluation.  The project will probably be reworked into a new language later.
