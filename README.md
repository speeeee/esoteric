esoteric
====

**esoteric** is a repo of all my projects that are for fun.  They shouldn't be used as they aren't meant to be.  Newest projects are at the bottom of the list.

A new project will begin every 1 or 2 weeks.

# Projects

## staircase
An esoteric visual language.  More info in README.md of staircase.

## wavlang
A very simple language used to modify *existing* WAV files.

## ulang
A stack-based language where all data are strings.

## Elem
A language with a LISP-style syntax where all data are strings.  The language allows the user to control when the interpreter evaluates expressions.

## L__I_
A language in its beginning stages that is supposed to be loosely based off of logic programming.

## GOLFLANG
A "language" based somewhat off of golf.

## finppn
Will be reintroduced in new repo.

# On hiatus

## LM

An experimental language based off of the idea of giving the user the ability to delay evaluation.  The project will probably be reworked into a new language later.

## Rstk
A somewhat serious stack-based language targetting C++.  ulang acts as a successor to Rstk.  More info soon.

## %%%%%
Project will continue more frequently once a more concrete idea of what it will be exists.  There will still be commits, but they are less about the language and more about the graphical side.
