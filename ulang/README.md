ulang
====

**ulang** is a stack-based language with the aim of having a very small and easily portable interpreter.  All data in ulang are strings, meaning that they can be manipulated as such, and there exist words that directly convert between a literal and its string-based counterpart (`>codes` and `>chars`).  Currently, ulang does not have much to offer, and is mostly just a for-fun project.

ulang is heavily influenced by other concatenative languages, like Joy and Factor.  The most notable example of this is ulang's adoption of quotes, which act as lambda expressions.
